Hello! I'm Janet, a 4th-year CS major. I'm a fairly visually oriented person and like to do illustration in my free time. I'd like to get some more hands-on experience with this project, particularly with the frontend.

Some ideas I have for this project include:
* user comments on classrooms/buildings 
* mapping feature
    * generate a route between multiple buildings/stops
