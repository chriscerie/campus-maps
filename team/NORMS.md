## Contributing

1. Check any branches or pull requests for similar files to avoid conflicts
2. If working on a new feature/bug, create a new branch with `git checkout -b branch-name`
3. Push changes and create a pull request
4. Wait for another member to review pull request and merge to main branch

## Git Styling

1. Commit messages should use imperative mood
    - Prefer `Fix login` over `Fixed login`
2. Branch names should be all lowercase with dashes to separate words
    - Prefer `fix-login` over `FixLogin`
